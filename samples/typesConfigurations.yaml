## Sample Types Configurations for zBuilder
##
##
## This file contains configuration allowing Migration Modeler to generate zBuilder Language configurations
##   that define a fixed build configuration for a set of mapped files.
## 
##   Please read through https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/adffz/dbb/3.0.x?topic=index-task-language#languageconfigurationsource
##
## Important notice: dbb-zappbuild is using different property names than zBuilder
## e.g., Compiler options for Cobol in dbb-zappbuild is called cobol_compileParms
