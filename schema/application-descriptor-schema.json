'internal submodule' identifies sub modules that are statically called within the application context only and can be published to the package as well. Dynamically called modules are not in scope for publishing, they are resolved during runtime execution.\nMore information on this, see documentation: https://github.com/IBM/dbb-git-migration-modeler/blob/main/AdvancedInformation.md#the-assessment-phase",
